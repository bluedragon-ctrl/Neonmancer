### Added
- Project scaffolding: Vite, placeholder title screen, unit tests with
  `node --test`, GitHub Actions CI (test + build), GitHub Pages deploy of
  `main`, PR template, docs skeleton.
- Fixed-timestep game loop (60 logic updates per second, interpolation
  alpha for rendering, capped catch-up).
- Action-mapped keyboard input with default bindings; taps shorter than a
  tick are never lost.
- Temporary on-screen readout of ticks, TPS, FPS and active actions.
